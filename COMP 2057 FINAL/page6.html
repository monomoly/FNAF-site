<h1><b>Send Off Speech</b></h1>
<center>
<p>In 2008, Fazbear's Fright, a horror attraction based on the murders at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, 
  was built 15 years after its closure and 6 years after Afton's last tape. On October 6th, 
  Afton was moved to the new location and began to roam its halls, seeking revenge on Michael. 
  Afton made a tape in which he screamed that he had escaped and knew that the Puppet would bring 
  Michael to him. Several days later, on October 14th, Afton made one final tape, saying "I see you," 
  while the destroyed suit's face, now known as Springtrap (though never called that in the episodes), 
  appeared. Under the guidance of the Puppet, Michael entered Fazbear's Fright that same year and set 
  it ablaze, burning William to death as he screamed in agony. Michael perished in the fire as well, 
  releasing all the trapped spirits, sending William to Hell, and causing Joseph to forgive Michael.
  <br>
  This led to an commonly known and well written spech given by Henry, Williams original business partner. 
  The purpose of this speech was meant to send William off to hell and hopefully release the spirits from 
  the animatronics.
