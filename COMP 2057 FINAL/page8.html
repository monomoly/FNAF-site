<h1><b>Fan Games</b></h1> 

<p> Five Nights at Freddy's has inspired hundreds of individuals to 
  create their own spin off fan games. Some of the apps developed are directly
  based off of the lore and play into a lot of the common easter eggs already 
  established in the series. Other games are known to have their own unique twists
  that introduce new concepts and alter the orginial story to be something
  completely different. I cannot name every fan game created but I do want to highlight 
  the more popluar ones that have been documented on over time. 
</p>

<h2> 1.One Night At Flumpty's</h2>
<p>The game "One Night At Flumpty's" lives up to its title by featuring only one
   night of gameplay, but with increasing difficulty as the night progresses. 
   The objective is for the player to survive until 6:00 AM by evading Flumpty
   Bumpty and his friends, including Birthday Boy Blam and Grunkfuss The Clown.
    As with the "Five Nights At Freddy's" series, failure to defend against these
     menacing cartoon characters results in a frightening jumpscare for the player.</p>

<h2>2. Five Nights at Candy's</h3>
<p>Regarded as one of the notable fan games of the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise,
   "Five Nights At Candy's" was first introduced nearly a year following the
    revolutionary release of the original game. The plot centers around a newly opened
     pizza place, which replaces the now-defunct Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria.</p>

<h2>3. Aftonbuilt</h4>

<p>Aftonbuilt (developed by JeliLiam) is a refreshingly dark take on the events that
   befall the blaze that destroyed Fazbear's Fright in Five Nights At Freddy's 3.
    The player will assume the role of a protagonist simply referred to as "The Mechanic,"
     who ominously teams up with the now-deceased founder of the infamous pizzeria franchise, 
     William Afton, to build him a new animatronic body, so he can walk amongst the living 
     once again. 
     <br>
  The gameplay of Aftonbuilt is what sets it apart from most Five Nights At Freddy's fan games.
   Instead of closing doors and simply avoiding or warding off animatronics, players have 
   the ability to fight back and trap the menacing animatronics in Aftonbuilt.
