<h1><b>The Bite Incidents</b></h1>

<h2> The Bite of 87</h2>

<p>
  This incident has been mentioned subtly throughout the series but there has not been any 
  details that have been properly revealed. The identity of the animatronic that caused the 
  attack and the specifics of the incident remain undisclosed, but the victim reportedly 
  suffered a loss of their frontal lobe and yet managed to survive. This occurrence was among 
  several other incidents that caused the company's reputation to diminish, resulting in a 
  significant decrease in business in the future.
<br>
  Following the incident, the animatronics were restricted from roaming around the building 
  during the day, and the management opted to limit their free movement to the nighttime to avoid 
  their servos from locking up, as explained by Phone Guy.

  <br>
  This incident has commonly been mixed up with the bite of 83.

<h2>The Bite of 83</h2>
<p>
  During the cutscene after completing Night 5 in Five Nights at Freddy's 4, fans were introduced 
  to a similar incident known as "The Bite of '83". The game's events occurred in 1983 and revolved 
  around a child who was being bullied by older kids and his older brother Michael during his party 
  at Fredbear's Family Diner. The bullies forced the victim towards Fredbear's stage and had Fredbear 
  "give the child a kiss" by pushing him into its mouth. The protagonist's head became stuck in the 
  animatronic's mouth, which then crunched down on the victim's head, whether by accident or not.

  <br>
  Ultimately, we are led to believe that the indirect murdering of his own younger brother, led 
  Micheal Afton to dig deeper into his fathers animatronics, making him the character we play as 
  when working the night shift in the games.
